# Dan Buda's Portfolio

<kbd>![Image]()</kbd>

The newest iteration of my development portfolio. Unliike my previous version, which was built with React and webpack and had different pages for projects and my tech skills, I wanted to focus this one on highlighting what I've built and what I've built stuff with in a very simple but well laid-out site with design at the forefront. So I ended up making this with a single HTML and a single CSS file, no JavaScript, and compiled with a relatively simple Gulp framework.

It's fully responsive, and takes accesibility into mind, using a lot of flexbox and a few @media queries where I felt necessary.
